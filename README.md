# SD211
## Optimisation projects

Following the course SD211 at **[Telecom Paristech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng)** (French nÂ°1 IT engineering Grande Ecole), this repository contains the subjects of the assignments and my solutions for them.

As always in Mathematical Optimisation, the goal here is to solve real-life problems (in the domain of signal processing here), by learning how to set problems into minimization formulae, and then solving these using the dual problem and lagrangian techniques.

We tackled image de-blurring, movie recommendation engines, and medical imagery analysis.
The problems addressed were : Dual problem, Lagrangian, Augmented Lagrangian, ADMM, Lagrangian Multiplicators, NMF, etc.

All my solutions are free of use (except if you are a Telecom student, then get the balls to do the project by yourself, buddy), but the assignments subjects are the exclusive property of **[Pascal Bianchi](https://bianchi.wp.imt.fr/)**.
